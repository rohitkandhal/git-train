Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December
And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor
Eagerly I wished the morrow -- vainly I had sought to borrow
From my books surcease of sorrow--sorrow for the last Lenore
From that reare and radiant maiden whome the angels named Lenore 
Nameless here forever.
